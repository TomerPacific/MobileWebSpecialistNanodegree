# The Web from Python

## Concept 03 - The echo server

> Question 1 of 3 : Take a look at the Python documentation for the BaseHTTPRequestHandler parent class in http.server. What's the name of the instance variable that contains the request path?

`path`

> Question 2 of 3 : Which of these silly words did not show up in the server's response when you tried the URIs above?

`stardust`

> Question 3 of 3 : The echo server wants to listen on the same port that the hello server does: port 8000. What happens if you try to start EchoServer.py while HelloServer.py is still running â€¦ or vice versa?

`The new server exits with an OSError exception`

## Concept 04 - Queries and quoting

> What does parse_qs('texture=fuzzy&animal=gray+squirrel') return?

`The dictionary {'texture': ['fuzzy'], 'animal:['gray squirrel']}`

## Concept 05 - HTML and forms

> Question 1 of 2 : What happens when you fill out the form and submit it?

`You see the username and password you entered in the output from the echo server`

> Question 2 of 2 : Using these two different forms as examples, can you tell what data in the form tells the browser which server to submit the form to?

`The URI in the form action attribute`

## Concept 06 - GET and POST

> Question 1 of 2 : Here's a list of several (non-HTTP) actions. Mark the ones that are idempotent.

- Adding zero to a numeric variable
- Setting a variable to the value 5
- Looking up an entry in a dictionary

> Question 2 of 2 : What's different about this HTTP request from ones you've seen before?

- The request line says "POST" instead of "GET"
- The form data is not in the URI path of the request
- The form data is somewhere else in the request
