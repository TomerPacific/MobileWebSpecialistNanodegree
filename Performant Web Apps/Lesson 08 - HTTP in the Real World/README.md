## Concept 02 - Handling more requests

> Question 1 of 2 : Why can't the bookmark server fetch a page from itself?

`http.server can only handle one request at a time`

> Question 2 of 2: Try posting an entry to your bookmark server that points to the server itself now. Did it work? If so, the server is now able to handle a second incoming request while processing another request.

`Yes, it worked!`
